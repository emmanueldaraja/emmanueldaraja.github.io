Data Analytics Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! This repository contains all the work and projects that I have completed in the field of data analysis. Here, you will find a range of analytical techniques, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

Feel free to explore the individual projects, which are organized by topic.

üìä About This Portfolio
As a data analyst, I am passionate about leveraging data to derive meaningful insights and solve complex problems. This portfolio showcases my ability to collect, clean, and analyze data, as well as my proficiency in presenting those insights through interactive visualizations and reports.

Here, you'll find the following:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers to prepare data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the structure and patterns in the data through visualizations and descriptive statistics.

Data Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotlye and tools like xcel, and Power bi to create insightful charts and dashboards.

Machine Learning: Developing predictive models using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and more.

SQL & Databases: Writing complex SQL queries to extract and analyze data from relational databases.

Reporting & Storytelling: Crafting actionable insights from data analysis and presenting them effectively through reports and dashboards.

üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used
Here are some of the tools, libraries, and technologies that I‚Äôve worked with in this portfolio:

Programming Languages: Python, SQL

Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn

Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL

Visualization Tools: Power BI

Data Manipulation: Excel, Google Sheets

Version Control: Git, GitHub

üìÇ Portfolio Structure
The portfolio is organized into individual project folders. Each project contains the following:

Project Description: A brief overview of the problem being solved and the methodology used.

Data Files: Datasets used in the analysis (if public).

Code: Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) or Python/R scripts with the analysis code.

Visualizations: Graphs, plots, and other visualizations generated as part of the analysis.

Final Reports: PDF or interactive dashboards summarizing the findings.

üåü Highlighted Projects
1. Forbes Billionaires Analysis ‚Äì Data Exploration & Insights
Overview: This project aims to explore the data from the latest Forbes Billionaires list and uncover key insights related to wealth distribution, geographical concentration, industry dominance, and trends in billionaire demographics. The analysis will also highlight any significant correlations, such as the relationship between age and net worth, and analyze the growth or decline of wealth across different countries and industries.

Technologies Used: excel,sql,power bi,Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

Key Insights: The top billionaires dominate a small group of industries, with the technology sector (e.g., Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos) leading the way, followed by fashion (Bernard Arnault) and finance (Warren Buffett).
           :The U.S. remains the global leader in the number of billionaires, followed by China. This suggests that economic opportunities in these countries are significantly greater, contributing to the wealth of their billionaires.

2. Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

3. COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization
Overview: Analyzed global COVID-19 data to identify trends and visualize case growth across countries.

Technologies Used:sql,excel, Python, Pandas, Plotly, Tableau

Key Insights: Developed interactive dashboards that track COVID-19 spread globally.

4. Employee Retention Analysis
Overview: Analyzed employee data to predict factors leading to higher retention rates.

Technologies Used: sql,Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Logistic Regression

Key Insights: Identified key factors influencing employee turnover, such as compensation and career development.
